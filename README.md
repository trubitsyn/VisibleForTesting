# VisibleForTesting

@VisibleForTesting annotation support for the IntelliJ platform.

## Supported annotation types

* [android.support.annotation.VisibleForTesting](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/annotation/VisibleForTesting.html)
* [com.google.common.annotations.VisibleForTesting](https://google.github.io/guava/releases/19.0/api/docs/com/google/common/annotations/VisibleForTesting.html)

# Motivation

It's time-consuming to annotate existing non-public methods: you have to remove modifiers and manually type the annotation.

Now you don't have to: plugin will do that for you.

# Features
